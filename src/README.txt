Finish alone under the UTA's guidance.




Part1: (about 20 hours)

Change Expression class into abstract class, and then make five children Expression classes.

Use factory method, create abstract Expression Factory class 
and its five children classes to achieve the functions of determine which kind of Expression and create it.

Add some new functions in ColorCombinations.

Create a list to store all the operators, check it one by one to determine which kind.

Pass the command into ColorCombinations to find which operator should do.






Part2:(about 10 hours)

Create a new class "makeInputFormal" to achieve the function of "let".
In this class it will turn the input into a normal string which we can deal with before.

Add some new functions for different kinds of Expression.

Make some comments in all files.

Include author name.

Add a new folder "Expression" consisting all Expression or ExpressionFactory classes.





Part2:(about 10 hours)

Add some new functions for different kinds of Expression.

Add a new kind of Expression type "MultipleParameterOperationExpression", 
which is for the infinite operations.

Add "+-*/%^!" operations, which works like "plus" "minus" and so on.
So I combine these.

Add an "if" command, in SpecialExpression. Because it works like the command of "color".

Add a new folder "Expression" consisting all Expression or ExpressionFactory classes.

Add Animation which includes time. So from now on if we call "t", 
the image will be changing all the time.
